      "Solution: Herein we propose an innovative approach to mitigate this problem Modular Construction This method embraces recycling and reuse taking a significant stride towards a circular economy   Modular construction involves utilizing engineered components in a manufacturing facility that are later assembled onsite These components are designed for easy disassembling enabling them to be reused in diverse projects thus significantly reducing waste and conserving resources  Not only does this method decrease construction waste by up to 90 but it also decreases construction time by 3050 optimizing both environmental and financial efficiency This reduction in time corresponds to substantial financial savings for businesses Moreover the modular approach allows greater flexibility adapting to changing needs over time  We believe by adopting modular construction the industry can transit from a take make and dispose model to a more sustainable reduce reuse and recycle model driving the industry towards a more circular and sustainable future The feasibility of this concept is already being proven in markets around the globe indicating its potential for scalability and realworld application\n"
